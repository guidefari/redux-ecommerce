# How to run
Make sure you have bun installed.
Then you start by installing modules:

```bash
bun install
```

To run client:

```bash
bun run dev:client
```

To run server:

```bash
bun run dev:server
```


## Architectural choices
- Switching to monorepo for quicker iteration between FE & BE.
  - I strongly considered going with NextJS, my default for fullstack TS apps.
