# How to run
Make sure you have bun installed.
Then you start by installing modules:

```bash
bun install
```

To run client:

```bash
bun run dev:client
```

To run server:

```bash
bun run dev:server
```

## Git pre-commit hook

I set up a simple pre-commit hook on my laptop.
Bash script located at: `./git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

set -eu

npx @biomejs/biome check --staged --files-ignore-unknown=true --no-errors-on-unmatched
```


## Architectural choices
- Switching to monorepo for quicker iteration between FE & BE.
  - I strongly considered going with NextJS, my default for fullstack TS apps.
